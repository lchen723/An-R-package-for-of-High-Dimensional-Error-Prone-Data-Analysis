# An R package for high dimensional error prone data analysis
This repository consists of the company bankruptcy prediction dataset, progamming code, and the analysis result by using the SIMEXBoost package in R CRAN. 

A list of files:
1. bankruptcy_data.csv: The full Company Bankruptcy Prediction dataset.
2. Tab2.R: An R script for examining simulation under the linear model (with type="normal").
3. Tab3.R: An R script for examining simulation under the Poisson model (with type="poisson").
4. Tab4.R: An R script for examining simulation under the AFT model (with type="AFT-normal").
5. SIMEXBoost_RJournal.csv: A summary of simulation results in Tables 2-4 in the manuscript.
